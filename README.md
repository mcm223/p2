## Other comments
This idea was inspired a high school friend and employee of [Belmont Books](http://www.belmontbooks.com/), a local bookstore in Belmont, MA.
She wrapped books in opaque paper and offered them for sale as a "Blind Date with a Book" for Valentine's Day.
I liked the idea and decided to adapt the idea into a web app that suggests a new book to read based on a user's 
preferences.
